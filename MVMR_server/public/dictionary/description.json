The remote host allows resuming SSL sessions with a weaker cipher than the one originally negotiated.","The remote host supports the use of anonymous SSL ciphers. While this enables an administrator to set up a service that encrypts traffic without having to generate and configure SSL certificates, it offers no way to verify the remote host's identity and renders the service vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack.\n\nNote: This is considerably easier to exploit if the attacker is on the same physical network. The remote service supports the use of anonymous SSL ciphers.","The remote host supports the use of SSL ciphers that operate in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode.

Therefore, it is recommended that these protocols be disabled entirely.\n\nNIST has determined that SSL 3.0 is no longer acceptable for secure communications. As of the date of enforcement found in PCI DSS v3.1, any version of SSL will not meet the PCI SSC's definition of 'strong cryptography'. The remote service encrypts traffic using a protocol with known weaknesses.","The remote host supports EXPORT_DHE cipher suites with keys less than or equal to 512 bits. Through cryptanalysis, a third party can find the shared secret in a short amount of time.\n\nA man-in-the middle attacker may be able to downgrade the session to use EXPORT_DHE cipher suites. Thus, it is recommended to remove support for weak cipher suites. The remote host supports a set of weak ciphers.","The remote host supports SSLv2 and therefore may be affected by a vulnerability that allows a cross-protocol Bleichenbacher padding oracle attack known as DROWN (Decrypting RSA with Obsolete and Weakened eNcryption). This vulnerability exists due to a flaw in the Secure Sockets Layer Version 2 (SSLv2) implementation, and it allows captured TLS traffic to be decrypted. A man-in-the-middle attacker can exploit this to decrypt the TLS connection by utilizing previously captured traffic and weak cryptography along with a series of specially crafted connections to an SSLv2 server that uses the same private key. The remote host may be affected by a vulnerability that allows a remote attacker to potentially decrypt captured TLS traffic.","The SSL implementation on the remote host has been shown to allow a cipher other than the one originally negotiated when resuming a session. An attacker that sees (e.g. by sniffing) the start of an SSL connection may be able to manipulate session cache to cause subsequent resumptions of that session to use a cipher chosen by the attacker.

The remote host advertises discouraged SSL/TLS ciphers.","The remote host is affected by a man-in-the-middle (MitM) information disclosure vulnerability known as POODLE. The vulnerability is due to the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode.\nMitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.\n\nAs long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can be 'rolled back' to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the client and service.\n\nThe TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism prevents 'version rollback' attacks without impacting legacy clients; however, it can only protect connections when the client and service support the mechanism. Sites that cannot disable SSLv3 immediately should enable this mechanism.\n\nThis is a vulnerability in the SSLv3 specification, not in any particular SSL implementation. Disabling SSLv3 is the only way to completely mitigate the vulnerability. It is possible to obtain sensitive information from the remote host with SSL/TLS-enabled services.","The remote host supports EXPORT_RSA cipher suites with keys less than or equal to 512 bits. An attacker can factor a 512-bit RSA modulus in a short amount of time.\n\nA man-in-the middle attacker may be able to downgrade the session to use EXPORT_RSA cipher suites (e.g. CVE-2015-0204). Thus, it is recommended to remove support for weak cipher suites. The remote host supports a set of weak ciphers.","The remote host supports the use of SSL ciphers that offer Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) encryption.  These cipher suites ensure that recorded SSL traffic cannot be broken at a future date if the server's private key is compromised. The remote service supports the use of SSL Perfect Forward Secrecy ciphers, which maintain confidentiality even if the key is stolen.","The remote host supports the use of SSL ciphers that offer weak encryption.\n\nNote: This is considerably easier to exploit if the attacker is on the same physical network. The remote service supports the use of weak SSL ciphers.","The remote host supports the use of SSL ciphers that offer medium strength encryption. Nessus regards medium strength as any encryption that uses key lengths at least 64 bits and less than 112 bits, or else that uses the 3DES encryption suite.\n\nNote that it is considerably easier to circumvent medium strength encryption if the attacker is on the same physical network. The remote service supports the use of medium strength SSL ciphers.","The remote service accepts connections encrypted using TLS 1.0. TLS 1.0 has a number of cryptographic design flaws. Modern implementations of TLS 1.0 mitigate these problems, but newer versions of TLS like 1.2 and 1.3 are designed against these flaws and should be used whenever possible.\n\nAs of March 31, 2020, Endpoints that aren’t enabled for TLS 1.2 and higher will no longer function properly with major web browsers and major vendors.\n\nPCI DSS v3.2 requires that TLS 1.0 be disabled entirely by June 30, 2018, except for POS POI terminals (and the SSL/TLS termination points to which they connect) that can be verified as not being susceptible to any known exploits.

The 'commonName' (CN) attribute in the SSL certificate does not match the hostname.","The server's X.509 certificate cannot be trusted. This situation can occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be broken, as stated below :\n\n  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the     server might not be descended from a known public     certificate authority. This can occur either when the     top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed     certificate, or when intermediate certificates are     missing that would connect the top of the certificate     chain to a known public certificate authority.\n\n  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate     that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can     occur either when the scan occurs before one of the     certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the     certificate's 'notAfter' dates.\n\n  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature     that either didn't match the certificate's information     or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by     getting the certificate with the bad signature to be     re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be     verified are the result of the certificate's issuer     using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not     support or does not recognize.\n\nIf the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out man-in-the-middle attacks against the remote host. The SSL certificate for this service cannot be trusted.","The X.509 certificate chain for this service is not signed by a recognized certificate authority.  If the remote host is a public host in production, this nullifies the use of SSL as anyone could establish a man-in-the-middle attack against the remote host. \n\nNote that this plugin does not check for certificate chains that end in a certificate that is not self-signed, but is signed by an unrecognized certificate authority. The SSL certificate chain for this service ends in an unrecognized self-signed certificate.","This plugin checks expiry dates of certificates associated with SSL- enabled services on the target and reports whether any have already expired.

A man-in-the-middle attacker who is able to able to intercept the traffic between a client and a server hosting a SAM database can exploit this flaw to force a downgrade of the authentication level, which allows the execution of arbitrary Samba network calls in the context of the intercepted user, such as viewing or modifying sensitive security data in the Active Directory (AD) database or disabling critical services. An SMB server running on the remote host is affected by the Badlock vulnerability.","The remote Windows host supports Server Message Block Protocol version 1 (SMBv1). Microsoft recommends that users discontinue the use of SMBv1 due to the lack of security features that were included in later SMB versions. Additionally, the Shadow Brokers group reportedly has an exploit that affects SMB; however, it is unknown if the exploit affects SMBv1 or another version. In response to this, US-CERT recommends that users disable SMBv1 per SMB best practices to mitigate these potential issues. The remote Windows host supports the SMBv1 protocol.","Nessus was able to obtain the version of SMB running on the remote host by sending an authentication request to port 139 or 445.\n\nNote that this plugin is a remote check and does not work on agents. It was possible to obtain information about the version of SMB running on the remote host.","It was possible to obtain the browse list of the remote Windows system by sending a request to the LANMAN pipe. The browse list is the list of the nearest Windows systems of the remote host.

It was possible to enumerate CPE names that matched on the remote system.","The remote host is missing one or more security patches. This plugin lists the newest version of each patch to install to make sure the remote host is up-to-date.\n\nNote: Because the 'Show missing patches that have been superseded' setting in your scan policy depends on this plugin, it will always run and cannot be disabled. The remote host is missing several patches.","One of several ports that were previously open are now closed or unresponsive.\n\nThere are several possible reasons for this :\n\n  - The scan may have caused a service to freeze or stop     running.\n\n  - An administrator may have stopped a particular service     during the scanning process.\n\nThis might be an availability problem related to the following :\n\n  - A network outage has been experienced during the scan,     and the remote network cannot be reached anymore by the     scanner.\n\n  - This scanner may has been blacklisted by the system     administrator or by an automatic intrusion detection /     prevention system that detected the scan.\n\n  - The remote host is now down, either because a user     turned it off during the scan or because a select denial     of service was effective.\n\nIn any case, the audit of the remote host might be incomplete and may need to be done again. Previously open ports are now closed.","Nessus was not able to successfully authenticate directly to the remote target on an available authentication protocol. Nessus was able to connect to the remote port and identify that the service running on the port supports an authentication protocol, but Nessus failed to authenticate to the remote service using the provided credentials. There may have been a protocol failure that prevented authentication from being attempted or all of the provided credentials for the authentication protocol may be invalid. See plugin output for error details.\n\nPlease note the following :\n\n- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for   valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not   another. For example, authentication may succeed via SSH   but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for   an available SNMP service.\n\n- Providing valid credentials for all available   authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but   the value of successful authentication for a given   protocol may vary from target to target depending upon   what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that   protocol. For example, successful authentication via SSH   is more valuable for Linux targets than for Windows   targets, and likewise successful authentication via SMB   is more valuable for Windows targets than for Linux   targets. Nessus was able to find common ports used for local checks, however, no credentials were provided in the scan policy.","Based on the remote operating system, it is possible to determine what the remote system type is (eg: a printer, router, general-purpose computer, etc). It is possible to guess the remote device type.","According to its self-reported version number, the Unix operating system running on the remote host is no longer supported.\n\nLack of support implies that no new security patches for the product will be released by the vendor. As a result, it is likely to contain security vulnerabilities. The operating system running on the remote host is no longer supported.","Using a combination of remote probes (e.g., TCP/IP, SMB, HTTP, NTP, SNMP, etc.), it is possible to guess the name of the remote operating system in use. It is also possible sometimes to guess the version of the operating system. It is possible to guess the remote operating system.","Each ethernet MAC address starts with a 24-bit Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI). These OUIs are registered by IEEE. The manufacturer can be identified from the Ethernet OUI.","According to the MAC address of its network adapter, the remote host is a VMware virtual machine. The remote host is a VMware virtual machine.","This plugin gathers MAC addresses discovered from both remote probing of the host (e.g. SNMP and Netbios) and from running local checks (e.g. ifconfig). It then consolidates the MAC addresses into a single, unique, and uniform list. This plugin gathers MAC addresses from various sources and consolidates them into a list.","Nessus was able to extract the banner of the Apache web server and determine which Linux distribution the remote host is running. The name of the Linux distribution running on the remote host was found in the banner of the web server.","Makes a traceroute to the remote host. It was possible to obtain traceroute information.","The remote host implements TCP timestamps, as defined by RFC1323.  A side effect of this feature is that the uptime of the remote host can sometimes be computed. The remote service implements TCP timestamps.","The remote host answers to an ICMP timestamp request.  This allows an attacker to know the date that is set on the targeted machine, which may assist an unauthenticated, remote attacker in defeating time-based authentication protocols.\n\nTimestamps returned from machines running Windows Vista / 7 / 2008 / 2008 R2 are deliberately incorrect, but usually within 1000 seconds of the actual system time. It is possible to determine the exact time set on the remote host.","According to its version, the remote web server is obsolete and no longer maintained by its vendor or provider.\n\nLack of support implies that no new security patches for the product will be released by the vendor. As a result, it may contain security vulnerabilities. The remote web server is obsolete / unsupported.","The default error page, default index page, example JSPs and/or example servlets are installed on the remote Apache Tomcat server. These files should be removed as they may help an attacker uncover information about the remote Tomcat install or host itself. The remote web server contains default files.","Nessus was able to detect a remote Apache Tomcat web server. The remote web server is an Apache Tomcat server.","The 'favicon.ico' file found on the remote web server belongs to a popular web server. This may be used to fingerprint the web server. The remote web server contains a graphic image that is prone to information disclosure.","The remote web server uses its default welcome page. Therefore, it's probable that this server is not used at all or is serving content that is meant to be hidden. The remote web server is not configured or is improperly configured.","The remote host is listening on UDP port 137 or TCP port 445, and replies to NetBIOS nbtscan or SMB requests.\n\nNote that this plugin gathers information to be used in other plugins, but does not itself generate a report.
