TLS 1.0 has a number of cryptographic design flaws. Modern implementations of TLS 1.0 mitigate these problems, but newer versions of TLS like 1.2 and 1.3 are designed against these flaws and should be used whenever possible.\n\nAs of March 31, 2020, Endpoints that aren’t enabled for TLS 1.2 and higher will no longer function properly with major web browsers and major vendors.\n\nPCI DSS v3.2 requires that TLS 1.0 be disabled entirely by June 30, 2018, except for POS POI terminals (and the SSL/TLS termination points to which they connect) that can be verified as not being susceptible to any known exploits. The remote service encrypts traffic using an older version of TLS.","cvss":"6.1 Medium CVSS2#AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:C/I:P/A:N","solution":"Enable support for TLS 1.2 and 1.3, and disable support for TLS 1.0.","risk":"TLS Version 1.0 Protocol Detection","type":"TLS Version 1.0 Protocol Detection","id_cve":[],"refs":["https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tls-oldversions-deprecate-00"]}],"SSL Cipher Suites Supported":[{"id":375,"host":"192.168.81.131","service":"25/smtp","description":"This plugin detects which SSL ciphers are supported by the remote service for encrypting communications.

This situation can occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be broken, as stated below :\n\n  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the     server might not be descended from a known public     certificate authority. This can occur either when the     top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed     certificate, or when intermediate certificates are     missing that would connect the top of the certificate     chain to a known public certificate authority.\n\n  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate     that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can     occur either when the scan occurs before one of the     certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the     certificate's 'notAfter' dates.\n\n  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature     that either didn't match the certificate's information     or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by     getting the certificate with the bad signature to be     re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be     verified are the result of the certificate's issuer     using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not     support or does not recognize.\n\nIf the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and identity of the web server.
